Linux Mars Core War Environment

This project will build a GUI development, debugging and emulation environment for the current standard of Redcode assembly.

lmars will allow you to create and pit core war code warriors against each
other in battle.

"Core War is a programming game created by D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney in
which two or more battle programs (called "warriors") compete for control of a
virtual computer. These battle programs are written in an abstract assembly
language called Redcode." (From Wikipedia)
